# üèÉ Quick Start

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** A quick start guide can be good to help folks get up and running with your API in a few steps. Some people prefer diving in with the basics rather than meticulously reading every page of documentation!
{% endhint %}

## Install the library

The best way to interact with our API is to use one of our official libraries:

{% tabs %}
{% tab title="Python" %}
```
# Install via pip
pip install --upgrade dalmatia
```
{% endtab %}
{% endtabs %}

{% hint style="info" %}
**Good to know:** Using tabs to separate out different languages is a great way to present technical examples or code documentation without cramming your docs with extra sections or pages per language.
